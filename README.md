# Mimic
Mimic is a Python program that takes in the contents of a txt file and randomly jumbles the words into 
a new version of its own, and prints it for you. I made this program as part of Kenzie Academy's software engineering program. 

# Usage Examples
txt file
```python
python mimic.py alice.txt
```

Go ahead and amuse yourself by calling this program with this program!
```python
python mimic.py mimic.py
```
